# PRHero

Ever struggled reviewing a large pull request in GitHub? PRHero is an open
source alternative UI for reviewing pull requests.

![](screen2.png)

What it will do:

1. View PR's with a file tree explorer to see what's changed.
2. Rich diffs using VSCode's monaco editor.
3. Pulls comments and CI checks inline to view the full status.
4. Read comments without being interrupted in your review process.
5. View only what's changed since you last looked at a pull request.

### Try it out

Try the example https://colinjfw.github.io/prhero/?owner=helm&repo=helm&pr=7323#Tree or
review any pull request at https://colinjfw.github.io/prhero/.

### What's missing

- Private repositories.
- Smarter file tree expansion (will hit GitHub rate limits quickly).
- Commenting.
- PR approval.
- Check run reports.

### What do you think?

Let me know :)
